    <p>
      <span className="block">Hello!</span>
      I'm Steven Kim, a <span className="text-secondary">Software Engineer</span> based in Seattle.
      I have a passion for learning all things tech, but have the most
      experience in Front-end development.

      Before finding my passion for programming, I spent
      10 years teaching martial arts, Taekwondo to be exact!
      I had the privilege of working with many people from
      different walks of life, as well as coaching a team to
      win Gold at Nationals!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not looking at my screen, I enjoy rock climbing
      or relaxing with my wife and dog.
