    <p>
      Hello! I'm Steven Kim, a <span className="highlight">Software Engineer</span> based in Seattle. What sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to continuous learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey into tech is complemented by a decade-long background in teaching martial arts. Not only did I coach a team to win Gold at Nationals, but this experience cultivated my interpersonal and leadership skills. It fostered my ability to work collaboratively with diverse individuals, a strength I can bring to any team.

      When I'm not looking at my screen, I enjoy rock climbing
      or relishing quiet moments with my wife and dog.
