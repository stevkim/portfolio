    <p>
      Hello! I'm Steven Kim, a{" "}
      <span className="highlight">Software Engineer</span> based in Seattle.
      What sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to continuous learning in
      the ever-evolving tech landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey into tech is complemented by my decade-long background in
      teaching martial arts, where I notably coached a team to win Gold at
      Nationals. This experience cultivated my interpersonal and leadership
      skills and fostered my ability to work collaboratively with diverse
      individuals - a strength I can bring to any team.

      When I'm not looking at my screen, I enjoy rock climbing or relishing
      quiet moments with my wife and dog.
